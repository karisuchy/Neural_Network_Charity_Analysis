# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to help a non-profit foundation predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk. To accomplish this task, the impact of each of the 34,000 previous recipients was analyzed to create a data-driven solution that could accurately predict the most cost-effective use of money for future donations.  

Using Python's Tensor-flow library, I designed, trained, and evaluated a deep learning neuro network. The goal was to create a model that evaluates many categories of input data to produce a clear decision-making result.  

This was accomplished in three steps
 1. Preprocessed the data for the neural network model.
 2. Compiled, trained, and evaluated the model.
 3. Optimized the model.

## Results

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? "Is_Successful 
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? EIN, and Name


Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance? 



## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
